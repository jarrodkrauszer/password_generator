# Password Generator

## Description

In this assignment we were task to create a function to generate a new passwored based on certain criteria.  The user is prompted a series of questions.  They are to select which characters they would like to be included in the password (lowercase, uppercase, numbers and specail characters). Lastly the user is asked to select a password length at least 8 characters long and no more than 128.
